# gene-cassette-finder
Proteins that interact with each other in vivo are often transcribed together under the same operon. Consequently, these genes are often found in close proximity in genomes. This program determines whether a set of genes (provided in fasta format) are found encoded in close proximity in the genomes available on NCBI's nr database.

This program requires a Mac operating system, with Python, version 3 or later, installed.
